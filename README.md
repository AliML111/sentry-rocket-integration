# sentry-rocket-integration
This is a script for integrating Rocket.Chat and Sentry to streamline your workflow.
I assume that you already have read this: https://docs.rocket.chat/use-rocket.chat/workspace-administration/integrations/sentry
You only need to paste this script in the script part of the integration in Rocket.Chat.
